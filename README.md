# Differences between 'turning down the sun' and stratospheric sulfate injection

## Motivating questions 

* How effective is sulfate geoengineering at moderating changes in temperature and precipitation extremes both regionally and seasonally? (Compare SSP585/SSP242 and G6sulfur) 

* How do differences between sulfate geoengineering and solar dimming affect these results? (Compare G6solar and G6sulfur). For example, there is evidence that the stratospheric heating from aerosol injection affects stratospheric-tropospheric coupling and leads to Eurasian winter warming. 

_Metrics used for temperature:_ daily maximum/minimum in DJF/JJA. 

_Metrics used for precipitation:_ Rx5day (Monthly maximum consecutive 5-day precipitation) and CWD (Maximum length of wet spell, maximum number of consecutive days with RR ≥ 1mm)

## What was done

Reproduce simple analysis figures for now on comparing changes in temperature and precipitation (and accounting for seasonality) between G6Solar and G6Sulfur, using UKESM model (only one available on Jasmin).
